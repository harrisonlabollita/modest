ModEST: Modular Electronic Structure Toolkit.

The Modular Electronic Structure Toolkit (ModEST) provides the necessary tooling to perform DMFT-type calculations in the context of
electronic structure including density-functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT).

Modularity is achieved through four key abstractions

* one-body elements,
* embedding,
* k-summation

These abstractions let you describe complex DMFT problems -- from simple single-site DMFT to multi-impurity, spin-orbit, or cluster DMFT
--in a clean and modular way.
